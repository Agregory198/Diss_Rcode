This repository contains two documents, a comma-separated-value (CSV) doecument and Quarto R document.

The CSV contains several variables associated with archaeological sites in southern Africa including site names, amount of lithics, correpsonding radiocarbon dates and associated errors. 
The Quarto document only subsets the data for the dated materials and does not utilize all variables in the CSV file. In the qusrto document are R scripts that produce an age-depth model using data from the CSV file and data extracted ffrom external sources.
